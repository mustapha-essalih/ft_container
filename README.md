# ft_Containers

## Overview

The ft_Containers project, part of the 42 curriculum, involves reimplementing several C++ Standard Library containers. This project enhances your understanding of data structures, iterators, and algorithms in C++.

## Containers

- **Vector**: Dynamic array with fast random access and dynamic resizing.
- **Stack**: LIFO structure using `ft::vector`.
- **Map**: Key-value pairs using a balanced binary search tree.
- **Set**: Unique element storage using a balanced binary search tree.

## Features

- Iterator support
- Exception safety
- Compliance with C++ Standard Library specifications

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and compile the code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mustapha-essalih/ft_container.git
cd ft_container
make
```

Run the tests:

```sh
./ft_container
```
